# üöÄ Bit-Block Starter CI/CD Workflows for GitLab

A powerful collection of **production-grade GitLab CI/CD templates** designed to help **solo founders**, **startup teams**, and **indie developers** ship faster with confidence.

These plug-and-play `.gitlab-ci.yml` templates cover everything from app deployment to Docker builds, security scanning, auto-labeling, Lambda functions, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Pick a template** from the list above based on your stack and needs.
2. **Copy the `.yml` file** into your GitLab project root or include via `include:` in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
3. **Set CI/CD variables** in GitLab for secrets like `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `ECR_REPO`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, etc.
4. **Push and run!** GitLab will automatically execute the defined stages.

## üîê Recommended CI/CD Variables

| Variable Name           | Purpose |
|-------------------------|---------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | Required for all AWS-based workflows |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret key |
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`       | Required for EC2-based deploys |
| `EC2_HOST`              | IP or hostname of your EC2 instance |
| `ECR_REPO`, `ECR_REGISTRY` | Used in Docker builds to push to ECR |
| `LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`  | Target Lambda function name |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN`          | For auto-labeling and auto-merging |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN`          | For Vercel preview environment deploys |
| `GH_TOKEN` / `GH_REPO`  | For GitHub Pages deploy (optional) |

## ‚úÖ Example: Enabling Auto-Merge and Labeling

- Branches like `feat/login-page` will get the `feature` label.
- Once the pipeline passes and approvals are satisfied, the MR will merge automatically.

---

## üîê Example: Terraform Workflow

This workflow runs `terraform fmt`, `terraform validate`, `terraform plan`, and optionally `terraform apply` (manual).

You can configure backend state using `.tf` backend blocks and CI/CD secrets.

---

## üîç Example: Security Scanning

The `security-scan.yml` uses [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) to identify vulnerabilities in code or images. Can be extended with Snyk or GitLab's built-in SAST for Ultimate users.

---

## üåç Need Preview Environments?

Use `preview-env.yml` to auto-deploy per-branch previews to services like Vercel or ECS. Pair with `clean-up-preview-env.yml` for full lifecycle management.

---

## üí° Pro Tips

- Modularize CI/CD by using `include: path` or templates folder.
- Protect `main` branch and enable required approvals.
- Monitor usage with GitLab CI/CD analytics.
- Scale deployments with multi-env support (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
- Pair with Observability tools like Grafana, Prometheus, or CloudWatch.
