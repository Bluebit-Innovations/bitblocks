# Bitblock Packs
The SaaS Automation Bitblock Pack is a high-value digital product for startups, founders, and DevOps teams. Its goal is to deliver instant setup power, save weeks of engineering, and serve as a go-to resource for infrastructure automation and DevOps.

## Project Structure

This repository provides a starter kit for building and deploying SaaS automation solutions. The structure is organized to help you quickly scaffold, customize, and launch your own infrastructure automation workflows.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Explore the `ai-agent/`, `sre-automation/`, and `container-orchestration/` directories** for automation modules and orchestration logic.
3. **Review the `cloud-readiness-checklist.md` and `devops-readiness-checklist.md`** to assess your environment.
4. **Customize the `terraform/` templates** to match your cloud or on-premises setup.
5. **Set up CI/CD using the templates in `cicd-pipelines/`.**
6. **Configure observability** with resources in the `observability/` directory.

## Key Features
