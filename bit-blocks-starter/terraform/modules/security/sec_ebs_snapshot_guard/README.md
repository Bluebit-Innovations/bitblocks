---

## 🚨 Requirements

* Terraform >= v1.0
* AWS Provider >= v5.0

## 🚩 IAM Permissions Required

The module automatically handles IAM role and policy creation. Ensure the Terraform execution role/user has permissions for:

* IAM roles and policies (`iam:*`)
* SNS topics and subscriptions (`sns:*`)
* CloudWatch event rules and targets (`events:*`)
* AWS Data Lifecycle Manager (`dlm:*`)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* The IAM policies generated by this module enforce encryption on snapshot creation. Ensure your teams understand this enforcement to prevent disruption.
* SNS email subscriptions require manual confirmation by recipients upon initial setup.
