# Observability 📊 | BitBlock Starter Pack

The **Observability** module of the BitBlock Starter Pack gives you instant, production-ready visibility into your cloud-native apps and infrastructure—right out of the box.

Designed for DevOps, SREs, solo founders, and platform teams, this folder helps you quickly add world-class monitoring, cost transparency, and logging with minimal setup.


## 📂 Folder Structure

### What’s Inside

- **cost-monitoring/**  
  Pre-built workflows, configs, and queries for cloud and Kubernetes cost visibility.  
  *Use this to track spend by service, namespace, team, or project. Get actionable insights and alerts for smarter budgeting and resource allocation.*

- **dashboards/**  
  Ready-to-import Grafana dashboards for key SRE, infrastructure, business, and cost metrics.  
  *Jumpstart your monitoring: Copy, customize, and connect to your data sources for instant observability.*

- **metrics/**  
  Sample Prometheus metrics and starter queries.  
  *Ideal for demos, onboarding, or building your first dashboards. Replace with real exporters in production environments.*

- **logging/**  
  Example configs and patterns for collecting, parsing, and visualizing logs.  
  *Integrate with popular tools (e.g., Loki) for end-to-end visibility from application to infrastructure.*

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Set Up Your Stack:**  
   Deploy Prometheus, Grafana, and your preferred logging backend (e.g., Loki, ELK).

2. **Import Dashboards:**  
   Load dashboards from `/dashboards` into Grafana to get immediate visibility.

3. **Connect Cost & Metrics Data:**  
   - Point `/metrics` samples to Prometheus for demo data, or wire up your exporters for live environments.
   - Use `/cost-monitoring` configs for real-time cost insights.

4. **Enable Logging:**  
   Apply patterns and configs in `/logging` to ship, parse, and search logs across your environment.

5. **Customize & Extend:**  
   Adapt dashboards, queries, and alerts to your team’s needs.

## 💡 Best Practices

- Use the sample metrics and configs for demos or quick starts—swap in production data as you go.
- Version-control all dashboards and observability configs to keep your monitoring stack consistent.
- Review and customize alerts, thresholds, and variables to fit your unique environment.
